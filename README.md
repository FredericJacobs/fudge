fudge - The App.net Client
=====

An early stage App.net iPhone client I had to discontinue because I don't have enough time to put it into production and assume everything that goes with that (maintenant, support ...)

I unfortunately will have to discontinue it's development because I'm severely lacking time here. I'm glad I realized this before putting it into production.
